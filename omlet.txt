Heat the butter in your frying pan until it starts to foam and sizzle but don't let it brown. 
Add the eggs in one go and swirl and shake the pan so they cover the surface. 
As soon as the eggs start to set pull the edges of the omelette into the centre of the pan and 
shake the pan so any liquid egg spills
 into the gaps.
